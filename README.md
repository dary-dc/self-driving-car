# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation

An interactive JavaScript application that simulates self-driving cars using neural networks and genetic algorithms. 
This project builds upon Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor's course and includes enhanced features for training visualization and performance.
Check out his amazing [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Radu).

## 🌟 Features

- **Neural Network Integration**: Implements a neural network to control car behavior.
- **Genetic Algorithm Training**: Utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve car performance over generations.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch cars navigate the track, learning from collisions and improving over time.
- **Extensive Code Comments**: In-depth explanations throughout the codebase to aid understanding and customization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core language for simulation logic.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Renders the simulation environment and car visuals.
- **CSS**: Styles the application interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo
### 2️⃣ Open the App

Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start the simulation.

## 🧠 How It Works

The simulation models a car equipped with sensors to detect its environment. A neural network processes sensor inputs to make driving decisions.
Through genetic algorithms, the system can evolve over successive generations (you have to save the smartest cars!!!), 
improving driving performance by selecting and breeding the best-performing neural networks.

## 🎓 Educational Foundation

This project is based on the course by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor, which teaches the fundamentals of building a self-driving car simulation in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Customizations

- **Enhanced Training Visualization**: Modified the simulation to provide a more engaging view of the training process, allowing users to observe cars as they learn to navigate the environment.
- **Detailed Code Annotations**: Added comprehensive comments throughout the code to explain functionality and facilitate learning.
